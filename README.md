The DAWG Protocol is a smart contract built on top of Ethereum that at its essence is a standard ERC20-style token with a delegated voting system forked from COMP/UNI that will allow all prospective holders to make governance decisions on behalf of the entire community. It was also be used for utility as currency in *all* products built for the Inumaki ecosystem. This will start with non-fungible tokens, auctions, marketplaces and open virtual worlds - but later on more advanced solutions will be developed and released.

[$DAWG](https://etherscan.io/token/0x51c5d692dd53872ce3f4bf5d97b94892a9619c63) will also be used to bootstrap a DAO that will govern the Inumaki ecosystem of products and libraries. We will always remain open-source, open-standard and have built in mechanisms to decentralize the community more & more from the core founding team as it grows in a exponential fashion. This includes, but is not limited to, the liquidity lock we have placed on the founding team's funds which is viewable [here](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x51c5D692Dd53872Ce3f4BF5D97B94892a9619c63?name=Inumaki&symbol=DAWG) and [here](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x6471Ed9CD4B27d33afF1085E71f7F797dD97697A?name=Inumaki&symbol=DAWG).

We loved watching web1.0 + web2.0 be built and enjoyed interacting/participating with all the virtual communities as they grew along with cultural impacts like memes that came from it. This is because at our heart and core, we are just another 'memecoin' obsessed with dogs. 

But don't be deceived - we have a deeper vendetta hidden beneath the surface. . . a vendetta against the increasingly opaque centralization of decentralized solutions and financial products being built for the new Web disguised by the form of 'investors', 'foundations', 'advisors' and 'talent acquisition'.

Now - we believe - is a critical time to contribute to Web3 in order to keep it centralized and keep out the big bad guys Satoshi Nakamoto and countless other pioneers warned us about. Today, you can help us to do this by joining our community, our government, our nation and our mafia. 

Pick up some [$DAWG](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x51c5d692dd53872ce3f4bf5d97b94892a9619c63), even if it is only one measly token. 

It will make you apart of the community and its government just as much as anyone else.
